# Fibonacci
Coded in C#

This is a program I made to display as much of the Fibonacci sequence as I could. You can do 3 things, find where your number is in the sequence (if it is wrong, then it will display the 2 closest numbers and their places), find what a certain place holds, or just generate as much of the Fibonacci sequence as the program can (93 places). The last number, in the sequence, that I was able to store in a variable was 7,540,113,804,746,346,429. Their are ways to get bigger numbers, it just would not be in a single variable.

This was coded in 2021
